3,process_wavs/179.wav,what do you recommend people do to in Hanson and bolster up their own immune system
4,process_wavs/202.wav,she was modeled after doctor shook it
5,process_wavs/180.wav,this is simply not true
6,process_wavs/118.wav,symptoms can include a cough sore throat headache and a fever that lasts a few days
7,process_wavs/37.wav,we still don't have enough evidence that these drugs are effective in humans
8,process_wavs/302.wav,course there's no way to know where Tom Hanks actually contracted the infection
9,process_wavs/32.wav,as the coronavirus spiraled into a Public Health crisis in China a fringe Theory started to take hold on the internet
10,process_wavs/212.wav,how healthy you are
11,process_wavs/116.wav,we do see cases of flu decrease as the weather gets warmer
12,process_wavs/151.wav,it's a pattern that has been repeated in history
13,process_wavs/204.wav,the current fatality rate globally according to the who is around 3 to 4%
14,process_wavs/87.wav,first let's talk about how our government officials are describing a drug called chloroquine
15,process_wavs/177.wav,well that is obviously very hopeful because you're right David there's a lot of anxiety
16,process_wavs/232.wav,in the spirit of optimism do you see the light at the end of the tunnel as has been described you have a timetable that you think this is going to take
17,process_wavs/198.wav,the President also tweeted over the weekend that are related drug
18,process_wavs/71.wav,what is it been like for you you were in quarantine for for quite some time after you left move on because of the potential exposure to the virus
19,process_wavs/211.wav,for healthy people it's not enough of a decrease it'll hardly make a dent
20,process_wavs/120.wav,that's why doctors are conducting studies in the United States China and all over the world to better understand what happens when you give these drugs to a covid-19 Shinto
21,process_wavs/245.wav,right now if somebody is concerned because they have symptoms
22,process_wavs/182.wav,the person delivering your takeout is not only concerned for their health and safety
23,process_wavs/215.wav,he consistently tested positive while in the hospital even though he was already feeling better
24,process_wavs/139.wav,I can't stress enough how vital it is that you don't use or consume anything unless specifically recommended by your doctor
25,process_wavs/205.wav,I love that
26,process_wavs/40.wav,he's now being isolated at a local hospital
27,process_wavs/229.wav,hoping to prove its Effectiveness against covid-19
28,process_wavs/35.wav,in Nigeria Health officials issued a warning about chloroquine
29,process_wavs/114.wav,and if you've tested negative at least two consecutive test taking a day apart then you're not at risk of infecting others
30,process_wavs/233.wav,most of the time for healthy people the symptoms go away on their own
31,process_wavs/23.wav,Christine spoke with billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman who recently made headlines with his radical proposal to save the US economy
32,process_wavs/225.wav,he consistently tested positive while in the hospital even though he was already feeling better
33,process_wavs/156.wav,of emergency room patients for other things as they used to or is it predominantly coronavirus or not much
34,process_wavs/187.wav,cases can become even more severe than clays
35,process_wavs/56.wav,and I want to ask you some specific questions about the
36,process_wavs/107.wav,the FDA says they're not aware of any evidence saying that Ibuprofen makes coronavirus symptoms worse
37,process_wavs/86.wav,have you ever seen a response of this magnitude the National Guard now just deployed
38,process_wavs/230.wav,what David am again remarkable work proud to have you as a colleague
39,process_wavs/240.wav,and can progress to organ failure sepsis sometimes even death
40,process_wavs/52.wav,then to an intermediate host before jumping to people just like the virus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic
41,process_wavs/173.wav,but you know there's been a lot of stories about people still not taking this very seriously
42,process_wavs/160.wav,what are the things that has happened over the last few days here in the United States as we've seen a crippling of the economy
43,process_wavs/74.wav,school closures can be a nightmare situation for some parents especially if you're also working at the same time
44,process_wavs/228.wav,I know we've already talked about the movie Contagion
45,process_wavs/101.wav,his wife is currently in critical care
46,process_wavs/192.wav,Brogan said testing out drugs that are already FDA-approved could drastically speed up the process of finding a treatment that is safe and effective for humans
47,process_wavs/266.wav,killing is korean-american and based in Los Angeles
48,process_wavs/291.wav,maybe they came in contact with somebody with the Coronavirus
49,process_wavs/48.wav,people have taken this idea to the extreme using hair dryers hot bats and UV lamps to try and disinfect themselves
50,process_wavs/159.wav,Nadia says her kids know that school is out because of the Coronavirus
51,process_wavs/298.wav,you're likely to soon hear other drug names mentioned as well
52,process_wavs/210.wav,it doesn't matter at all
53,process_wavs/149.wav,I asked my colleague young what advice did she have four people out there
54,process_wavs/22.wav,but it has not been approved as a treatment for the Coronavirus
55,process_wavs/125.wav,their ordeal was not over though
56,process_wavs/277.wav,5 days later President Trump reverse course
57,process_wavs/238.wav,getting a letter from China or any country that has coronavirus cases is not going to make you sick
58,process_wavs/161.wav,told us many of our customers cancelled their Chinese New Year bookings last minute
59,process_wavs/9.wav,now there's no definitive study on this but dr. foutch she has been dealing with viruses his entire professional life
60,process_wavs/209.wav,that was Bill Ackman the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management
61,process_wavs/282.wav,so gratitude goes a long way
62,process_wavs/51.wav,she described what happened on Instagram
63,process_wavs/97.wav,last November Melanie and John Herring set off on what was supposed to be a 6-month retirement trip through Asia
64,process_wavs/184.wav,CNN David Culver was in China as the coronavirus outbreak began late last year
65,process_wavs/39.wav,what would be your advice to help people should think about this now given your experience
66,process_wavs/41.wav,now it didn't say whether those patients had any underlying risks
67,process_wavs/0.wav,this is not her first rodeo
68,process_wavs/123.wav,a lot of people will go through something similar to John's experience
69,process_wavs/237.wav,Deepak how are you coping
70,process_wavs/216.wav,there is no credible information to back this up and the posts mostly come from unverified social media accounts
71,process_wavs/190.wav,he recently announced that the state had procured thousands of doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine
72,process_wavs/136.wav,but Public Health experts say there's no way to know this for sure
73,process_wavs/259.wav,last week after time off posted a video
74,process_wavs/141.wav,as a result there's a lot of information and misinformation out there
75,process_wavs/203.wav,even on social media we're seeing the same thing
76,process_wavs/109.wav,the CDC guidelines say that if you're not showing symptoms like a cough or fever
77,process_wavs/300.wav,she is our resident explainer in Chief of all things money
78,process_wavs/137.wav,as things stand right now here in the United States and I think in many places around the world
79,process_wavs/18.wav,Nadia is like many of you juggling multiple jobs right now
80,process_wavs/99.wav,fortunately for Nadia a former teacher at Nora School reached out to families in the neighborhood offering childcare help
81,process_wavs/165.wav,just as John was feeling better Japanese authorities transferred him to a local hospital
82,process_wavs/147.wav,what kind of treatment do you have access to will undoubtedly shape your experience
83,process_wavs/218.wav,and I also really appreciate this idea that to slow down your thoughts
84,process_wavs/227.wav,where you contracted the virus
85,process_wavs/102.wav,describing the decision obviously of living in this this apartment in the garage away from your family
86,process_wavs/255.wav,and how best to talk to your kids about the outbreak
87,process_wavs/53.wav,so during our CNN Town Hall I asked dr. Anthony falchi the director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases
88,process_wavs/20.wav,and ask them how the coronavirus has affected their family life
89,process_wavs/131.wav,performing at a comedy show called Asian strike back earlier this month
90,process_wavs/251.wav,what schools in communities are doing what they can to lift some of the child care in financial load
91,process_wavs/29.wav,wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds cover your mouth and nose when you cough and seek treatment if you're not feeling well
92,process_wavs/167.wav,have you heard him say this isn't the first time that an infectious disease outbreak has been linked to certain immigrant groups
93,process_wavs/162.wav,dr. Anne schuchat is the principal deputy director of the CDC
94,process_wavs/260.wav,but we all have the capability to enhance our own immune system
95,process_wavs/126.wav,thankfully that was the worst of it
96,process_wavs/299.wav,and there are several theories why
97,process_wavs/157.wav,so Kate asked her daughter's pediatrician and other experts for advice
98,process_wavs/12.wav,you have two daughters I have three daughters your daughters are five and two
99,process_wavs/214.wav,here's Randi Weingarten president of the American Federation of teachers
100,process_wavs/93.wav,it is unlikely that it will live after being moved travel then exposed to different temperatures
101,process_wavs/244.wav,on Wednesday Hollywood actor Tom Hanks confirm he had the virus and he's in Australia where summer just ended
102,process_wavs/243.wav,2 challenging question but is there something you would point to that you would say was the most important factor and that sort of recovery
103,process_wavs/45.wav,I mean I made it very real
104,process_wavs/171.wav,earlier this year with only a handful of Novel coronavirus cases in America
105,process_wavs/267.wav,he's also the director of the medical ethics division at NYU langone Medical Center
106,process_wavs/63.wav,I want to reiterate that we don't know how effective any of these treatments will be
107,process_wavs/55.wav,for more on this I turn to a friend and then expert CNN medical analyst Arthur Kaplan
108,process_wavs/150.wav,this is a really important question
109,process_wavs/115.wav,as things stand now doctor circuit how easy would it be for that person to get tested
110,process_wavs/191.wav,the news media is constantly turning out updates and information
111,process_wavs/186.wav,San Francisco State University found that news about coronavirus discrimination increase by 50% across the country from February 9th through March 7th
112,process_wavs/58.wav,scientist in both China and the West have widely dismissed E-Series although that hasn't stopped them from spreading
113,process_wavs/148.wav,you started off by talking about the fact that you were hopeful about what you're now seeing in China
114,process_wavs/172.wav,and the entire ship was put in the quarantine
115,process_wavs/154.wav,really know the answer to that question
116,process_wavs/100.wav,what about over there how did businesses adapt to The New Normal
117,process_wavs/185.wav,but also in institutional policies like the Immigration Act of 1924
118,process_wavs/166.wav,John symptoms were not nearly as severe as clay Bentleys
119,process_wavs/65.wav,it becomes a little a little blurry there right it's not just about the economy in that situation
120,process_wavs/10.wav,which severely limited immigration from Asia and parts of Europe
121,process_wavs/104.wav,the best way to protect yourself is to practice good hygiene
122,process_wavs/288.wav,now some doctors are having to make those hard choices in real life
123,process_wavs/178.wav,make sure they could purchase groceries for them if they can't get out of the house
124,process_wavs/303.wav,finally if you have any questions please record them as a voice memo and email them to ask Sanjay at cnn.com
125,process_wavs/242.wav,these are myths and they really work
126,process_wavs/176.wav,maybe clear the novel coronavirus can infect anyone regardless of age with nicity
127,process_wavs/8.wav,the other drug name being floated around is an antiviral called run Desert View
128,process_wavs/174.wav,and there's also no way to know for sure what role heat or humidity have to play here
129,process_wavs/1.wav,CNN spoke to Arne Duncan the former education secretary under President Obama
130,process_wavs/84.wav,using the plasma of people who have recovered
131,process_wavs/69.wav,that's just one month
132,process_wavs/108.wav,and she's not alone
133,process_wavs/94.wav,it might even include them in the podcast
134,process_wavs/263.wav,that it's safe to go back to a more normal life where you can spend time with your kids again
135,process_wavs/142.wav,same three people overdosed on the drug after hearing it described as a possible treatment
136,process_wavs/11.wav,leaving aside International countries for a while would you recommend people not travel
137,process_wavs/220.wav,and maybe the right question is how should I act around my kids with regard to this in
138,process_wavs/270.wav,people who have underlying health conditions are those who are older do need to take extra precautions
139,process_wavs/250.wav,you know what strikes me Rachel that you all are being very diligent about this in in modeling right behavior and I hope people are listening
140,process_wavs/289.wav,it's not just individual attacks
141,process_wavs/17.wav,that the virus was man made in a lab
142,process_wavs/121.wav,we are seeing cases of the coronavirus currently spreading in hot countries
143,process_wavs/140.wav,I've heard this question a lot and there's some Merit to this concern
144,process_wavs/128.wav,then one day after 2 weeks he finally had a test come back negative
145,process_wavs/112.wav,what is the guidance the CDC is giving
146,process_wavs/25.wav,and there are multiple stages of those trials
147,process_wavs/88.wav,I'm in February roses business was down some 70 to 80%
148,process_wavs/133.wav,that's why in some states they are beginning to
149,process_wavs/269.wav,tip as much as you can
150,process_wavs/226.wav,my specialty is medicine not the economy
151,process_wavs/284.wav,the economy is also top of mine for New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo
152,process_wavs/66.wav,on February 6th one of the thousands of people who'd been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship with them tested positive for the virus
153,process_wavs/113.wav,we also don't know if it would cause problems during the pregnancy or affect the baby
154,process_wavs/68.wav,chloroquine is used to treat malaria and has been around for decades
155,process_wavs/271.wav,Gilead Sciences which manufactures RAM does severe is pulling back an emergency request for the drug due to overwhelming demand
156,process_wavs/193.wav,but if the narrative is look if you're young and healthy you'll be okay but the elderly people seventies and eighties in particular have a lot to worry about
157,process_wavs/247.wav,hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic commonly known as a z-pack could become game changers
158,process_wavs/158.wav,we're in this together so let's help each other out
159,process_wavs/188.wav,people who will inquire onto neighbor's well-being especially elderly in
160,process_wavs/207.wav,he narrowly escaped Wuhan just before the city was put in the lockdown on January 23rd
161,process_wavs/304.wav,the issue that I think a lot of people are starting to ask about is is this an either-or conversation is there either economic damage
162,process_wavs/153.wav,we've actually done a good job of staying in touch and it's been it's been really nice
163,process_wavs/201.wav,and this is what he said
164,process_wavs/3.wav,NBC News spoke to the wife who said they learned of the drugs connection to a coronavirus during a news conference on TV
165,process_wavs/81.wav,some point to the physics of the virus itself other point to the fact that kids major transmitters of the flu aren't in school anymore
166,process_wavs/92.wav,but we do know that pregnant women are more vulnerable to other respiratory illnesses like the flu
167,process_wavs/181.wav,I spoke to her in the hospital and asked if she was surprised it had now become the epicenter of New York State's coronavirus outbreak
168,process_wavs/208.wav,he says he's been seeing a lot of great leadership and creativity on the local and state level
169,process_wavs/59.wav,our team visited Nadia and her family at home last week to see how they've been doing
170,process_wavs/57.wav,your daily work changed I mean are you still seeing the same number
171,process_wavs/236.wav,of course everyone's situation is different
172,process_wavs/91.wav,there is currently no cure and while we're search is underway it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes available
173,process_wavs/111.wav,it's already been tested on adults diagnosed with a coronavirus in the United States and China
174,process_wavs/292.wav,director of the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention dr. Robert Redfield discuss friend as of year-end Congressional testimony earlier this month
175,process_wavs/219.wav,it was a recent small study of 9 women who were infected with the virus and none of their babies were affected by
176,process_wavs/290.wav,but now this is becoming a permanent home or at least temporary permanent home
177,process_wavs/152.wav,but I can reduce your ability to fight off an infection
178,process_wavs/135.wav,there are many home remedies doing the rounds drinking water or taking garlic or vitamin C
179,process_wavs/224.wav,but it really does strike me even when I've been at the hospital recently Justin that
180,process_wavs/49.wav,some of the rumors out there are ridiculous
181,process_wavs/6.wav,it seems Rachel sometimes the sentiment is I'm not taking it seriously
182,process_wavs/60.wav,or else damage
183,process_wavs/33.wav,I spoke with Rachel patzer director of the center of Health Services Research and Emory and her husband dr. Justin Schrager who's a physician in Emery's emergency department
184,process_wavs/28.wav,President Donald Trump is previously suggested that heat kills the virus and that it would be over by Spring
185,process_wavs/280.wav,from what we know so far about 80% of patients who get the novel coronavirus experience mild symptoms
186,process_wavs/82.wav,if you feel like you have symptoms of the coronavirus the best thing to do is to call your doctor
187,process_wavs/19.wav,but is there a concern though I mean not to paint a darker picture on this but there's a lot about this virus we still don't know
188,process_wavs/95.wav,before long john felt better
189,process_wavs/78.wav,comedy can't erase the hurt being felt by many in our country
190,process_wavs/134.wav,the president rebuking racism is a welcome development and the right thing to do
191,process_wavs/44.wav,hear Siemens medical analyst and infectious disease specialist dr. Celine gounder
192,process_wavs/4.wav,this is largely based on a small study in France that excluded some people who either left the hospital
193,process_wavs/138.wav,and some people the virus can stay in the body even after they're no longer showing symptoms
194,process_wavs/217.wav,she's in charge of the Medical Center's response to the growing pandemic
195,process_wavs/248.wav,how much do you think is is too much or how do you prefer to modulate how much information you're taking in
196,process_wavs/96.wav,that's my colleague kyung Law Senior National correspondent for CNN
197,process_wavs/143.wav,the best way to cheer yourself up is to cheer up someone else
198,process_wavs/38.wav,your approach in terms of how you convey knowledge and information whether it be an adult versus a child
199,process_wavs/257.wav,not everyone has been able to make it work like Nadia's family
200,process_wavs/64.wav,she herself was targeted
201,process_wavs/13.wav,meaning only the most serious cases would be reported and there were likely many more cases out there
202,process_wavs/183.wav,vaccine Trials take months or years in order to be proven safe and effective for humans
203,process_wavs/110.wav,this one is a case-by-case basis
204,process_wavs/79.wav,just last week Eugenie grey a blogger in New York was out walking her dog when a passerby kick the dog
205,process_wavs/169.wav,the Centers for Disease Control and prevention came out with a report last week that showed young adults between the ages of 20 and 44 were making up 20% of coronavirus hospitalization
206,process_wavs/2.wav,and then there's the prospect of a vaccine
207,process_wavs/24.wav,unfortunately the list goes on and on here's what President Trump had to say when a reporter asked him about
208,process_wavs/200.wav,I asked him how can you really put a value on human life
209,process_wavs/73.wav,after taking a form of chloroquine used to clean aquariums
210,process_wavs/293.wav,very hard to actually obviously do that in the hospital and I'm not talkin just in terms of care of patients I'm talking just
211,process_wavs/75.wav,but there are experts who believe it is actually much closer to 1%
212,process_wavs/231.wav,now these families at that are really suffering economically and they concerned that their quality of life is greatly diminished
213,process_wavs/103.wav,there was some early reports in Japan and China of people becoming re-infected
214,process_wavs/16.wav,and after touching it wash your own hands with soap and water
215,process_wavs/295.wav,people who get infected will typically get sick with a mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illness similar to a common cold
216,process_wavs/21.wav,so it's not clear if these young adults were more vulnerable to the infections than others
217,process_wavs/127.wav,were there any memorable moments that really stood out
218,process_wavs/34.wav,I believe him when he says that it's very unlikely that you'll get the virus again
219,process_wavs/62.wav,Banner Health a company that operates acute care hospitals released a statement on Monday confirming that a man in Arizona had died
220,process_wavs/30.wav,let me tell you what I know
221,process_wavs/235.wav,is there a concern that there could be a Resurgence of the infection
222,process_wavs/168.wav,and how for some people life is slowly beginning to get back to normal
223,process_wavs/155.wav,testing every individual given that you're not going to do anything different
224,process_wavs/76.wav,experts say one wouldn't be ready this year
225,process_wavs/206.wav,the risk of dying is still much higher in older people
226,process_wavs/223.wav,getting the results could take months and in the meantime
227,process_wavs/249.wav,they were worried because they've been told essentially stay home we can visit them
228,process_wavs/213.wav,I asked her if she knows anyone personally who is contracted the Coronavirus
229,process_wavs/195.wav,let's walk through some of the biggest myths and give you the facts
230,process_wavs/262.wav,and I'm just wondering
231,process_wavs/27.wav,experts are still trying to figure out the exact source of the virus but Research indicates that it likely originated in bats
232,process_wavs/296.wav,how should I talk to my kids about this
233,process_wavs/258.wav,this idea that is people start to come back together again
234,process_wavs/145.wav,anti-inflammatories can sometimes suppress your immune system
235,process_wavs/15.wav,check in on your neighbors
236,process_wavs/98.wav,local community sort of leading the way here in the United States and the federal government seeming to play a little catch
237,process_wavs/105.wav,stop taking the drug Duda side effects or gout worse including one person who died
238,process_wavs/46.wav,work on a study published last weekend that identified 69 existing drugs that could be tested against the Coronavirus
239,process_wavs/164.wav,sometimes you're slow down your breath and then the slowing down of thoughts follow
240,process_wavs/268.wav,and would begin trial starting Tuesday
241,process_wavs/276.wav,but if you have a weakened immune system or an underlying Condition it's better to take Tylenol
242,process_wavs/83.wav,umf worked on lots of pandemics and outbreaks in the past
243,process_wavs/254.wav,she's reporting on the coronavirus while also taking care of two young children at home
244,process_wavs/163.wav,after being asked what treatment he was getting you can hear him struggling to respond
245,process_wavs/287.wav,thankfully people have been calling out the racism they are witnessing
246,process_wavs/273.wav,but with an early diagnosis and the right treatment they too can recover
247,process_wavs/294.wav,the World Health Organization has said these methods are ineffective and shouldn't be used as I can actually irritate your skin or just burn you
