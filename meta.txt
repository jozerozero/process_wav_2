process_wavs/43.wav	play as a retired law enforcement officer in Georgia and his also tested positive for Coronavirus

process_wavs/253.wav	even comedians are talkin about it

process_wavs/61.wav	I wanted to be sure this

process_wavs/179.wav	what do you recommend people do to in Hanson and bolster up their own immune system

process_wavs/202.wav	she was modeled after doctor shook it

process_wavs/180.wav	this is simply not true

process_wavs/118.wav	symptoms can include a cough sore throat headache and a fever that lasts a few days

process_wavs/37.wav	we still don't have enough evidence that these drugs are effective in humans

process_wavs/302.wav	course there's no way to know where Tom Hanks actually contracted the infection

process_wavs/32.wav	as the coronavirus spiraled into a Public Health crisis in China a fringe Theory started to take hold on the internet

process_wavs/212.wav	how healthy you are

process_wavs/116.wav	we do see cases of flu decrease as the weather gets warmer

process_wavs/151.wav	it's a pattern that has been repeated in history

process_wavs/204.wav	the current fatality rate globally according to the who is around 3 to 4%

process_wavs/87.wav	first let's talk about how our government officials are describing a drug called chloroquine

process_wavs/177.wav	well that is obviously very hopeful because you're right David there's a lot of anxiety

process_wavs/232.wav	in the spirit of optimism do you see the light at the end of the tunnel as has been described you have a timetable that you think this is going to take

process_wavs/198.wav	the President also tweeted over the weekend that are related drug

process_wavs/71.wav	what is it been like for you you were in quarantine for for quite some time after you left move on because of the potential exposure to the virus

process_wavs/211.wav	for healthy people it's not enough of a decrease it'll hardly make a dent

process_wavs/120.wav	that's why doctors are conducting studies in the United States China and all over the world to better understand what happens when you give these drugs to a covid-19 Shinto

process_wavs/245.wav	right now if somebody is concerned because they have symptoms

process_wavs/182.wav	the person delivering your takeout is not only concerned for their health and safety

process_wavs/215.wav	he consistently tested positive while in the hospital even though he was already feeling better

process_wavs/139.wav	I can't stress enough how vital it is that you don't use or consume anything unless specifically recommended by your doctor

process_wavs/205.wav	I love that

process_wavs/40.wav	he's now being isolated at a local hospital

process_wavs/229.wav	hoping to prove its Effectiveness against covid-19

process_wavs/35.wav	in Nigeria Health officials issued a warning about chloroquine

process_wavs/114.wav	and if you've tested negative at least two consecutive test taking a day apart then you're not at risk of infecting others

process_wavs/233.wav	most of the time for healthy people the symptoms go away on their own

process_wavs/23.wav	Christine spoke with billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman who recently made headlines with his radical proposal to save the US economy

process_wavs/225.wav	he consistently tested positive while in the hospital even though he was already feeling better

process_wavs/156.wav	of emergency room patients for other things as they used to or is it predominantly coronavirus or not much

process_wavs/187.wav	cases can become even more severe than clays

process_wavs/56.wav	and I want to ask you some specific questions about the

process_wavs/107.wav	the FDA says they're not aware of any evidence saying that Ibuprofen makes coronavirus symptoms worse

process_wavs/86.wav	have you ever seen a response of this magnitude the National Guard now just deployed

process_wavs/230.wav	what David am again remarkable work proud to have you as a colleague

process_wavs/240.wav	and can progress to organ failure sepsis sometimes even death

process_wavs/52.wav	then to an intermediate host before jumping to people just like the virus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic

process_wavs/173.wav	but you know there's been a lot of stories about people still not taking this very seriously

process_wavs/160.wav	what are the things that has happened over the last few days here in the United States as we've seen a crippling of the economy

process_wavs/74.wav	school closures can be a nightmare situation for some parents especially if you're also working at the same time

process_wavs/228.wav	I know we've already talked about the movie Contagion

process_wavs/101.wav	his wife is currently in critical care

process_wavs/192.wav	Brogan said testing out drugs that are already FDA-approved could drastically speed up the process of finding a treatment that is safe and effective for humans

process_wavs/266.wav	killing is korean-american and based in Los Angeles

process_wavs/291.wav	maybe they came in contact with somebody with the Coronavirus

process_wavs/48.wav	people have taken this idea to the extreme using hair dryers hot bats and UV lamps to try and disinfect themselves

process_wavs/159.wav	Nadia says her kids know that school is out because of the Coronavirus

process_wavs/298.wav	you're likely to soon hear other drug names mentioned as well

process_wavs/210.wav	it doesn't matter at all

process_wavs/149.wav	I asked my colleague young what advice did she have four people out there

process_wavs/22.wav	but it has not been approved as a treatment for the Coronavirus

process_wavs/125.wav	their ordeal was not over though

process_wavs/277.wav	5 days later President Trump reverse course

process_wavs/238.wav	getting a letter from China or any country that has coronavirus cases is not going to make you sick

process_wavs/161.wav	told us many of our customers cancelled their Chinese New Year bookings last minute

process_wavs/9.wav	now there's no definitive study on this but dr. foutch she has been dealing with viruses his entire professional life

process_wavs/209.wav	that was Bill Ackman the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management

process_wavs/282.wav	so gratitude goes a long way

process_wavs/51.wav	she described what happened on Instagram

process_wavs/97.wav	last November Melanie and John Herring set off on what was supposed to be a 6-month retirement trip through Asia

process_wavs/184.wav	CNN David Culver was in China as the coronavirus outbreak began late last year

process_wavs/39.wav	what would be your advice to help people should think about this now given your experience

process_wavs/41.wav	now it didn't say whether those patients had any underlying risks

process_wavs/0.wav	this is not her first rodeo

process_wavs/123.wav	a lot of people will go through something similar to John's experience

process_wavs/237.wav	Deepak how are you coping

process_wavs/216.wav	there is no credible information to back this up and the posts mostly come from unverified social media accounts

process_wavs/190.wav	he recently announced that the state had procured thousands of doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine

process_wavs/136.wav	but Public Health experts say there's no way to know this for sure

process_wavs/259.wav	last week after time off posted a video

process_wavs/141.wav	as a result there's a lot of information and misinformation out there

process_wavs/203.wav	even on social media we're seeing the same thing

process_wavs/109.wav	the CDC guidelines say that if you're not showing symptoms like a cough or fever

process_wavs/300.wav	she is our resident explainer in Chief of all things money

process_wavs/137.wav	as things stand right now here in the United States and I think in many places around the world

process_wavs/18.wav	Nadia is like many of you juggling multiple jobs right now

process_wavs/99.wav	fortunately for Nadia a former teacher at Nora School reached out to families in the neighborhood offering childcare help

process_wavs/165.wav	just as John was feeling better Japanese authorities transferred him to a local hospital

process_wavs/147.wav	what kind of treatment do you have access to will undoubtedly shape your experience

process_wavs/218.wav	and I also really appreciate this idea that to slow down your thoughts

process_wavs/227.wav	where you contracted the virus

process_wavs/102.wav	describing the decision obviously of living in this this apartment in the garage away from your family

process_wavs/255.wav	and how best to talk to your kids about the outbreak

process_wavs/53.wav	so during our CNN Town Hall I asked dr. Anthony falchi the director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases

process_wavs/20.wav	and ask them how the coronavirus has affected their family life

process_wavs/131.wav	performing at a comedy show called Asian strike back earlier this month

process_wavs/251.wav	what schools in communities are doing what they can to lift some of the child care in financial load

process_wavs/29.wav	wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds cover your mouth and nose when you cough and seek treatment if you're not feeling well

process_wavs/167.wav	have you heard him say this isn't the first time that an infectious disease outbreak has been linked to certain immigrant groups

process_wavs/162.wav	dr. Anne schuchat is the principal deputy director of the CDC

process_wavs/260.wav	but we all have the capability to enhance our own immune system

process_wavs/126.wav	thankfully that was the worst of it

process_wavs/299.wav	and there are several theories why

process_wavs/157.wav	so Kate asked her daughter's pediatrician and other experts for advice

process_wavs/12.wav	you have two daughters I have three daughters your daughters are five and two

process_wavs/214.wav	here's Randi Weingarten president of the American Federation of teachers

process_wavs/93.wav	it is unlikely that it will live after being moved travel then exposed to different temperatures

process_wavs/244.wav	on Wednesday Hollywood actor Tom Hanks confirm he had the virus and he's in Australia where summer just ended

process_wavs/243.wav	2 challenging question but is there something you would point to that you would say was the most important factor and that sort of recovery

process_wavs/45.wav	I mean I made it very real

process_wavs/171.wav	earlier this year with only a handful of Novel coronavirus cases in America

process_wavs/267.wav	he's also the director of the medical ethics division at NYU langone Medical Center

process_wavs/63.wav	I want to reiterate that we don't know how effective any of these treatments will be

process_wavs/55.wav	for more on this I turn to a friend and then expert CNN medical analyst Arthur Kaplan

process_wavs/150.wav	this is a really important question

process_wavs/115.wav	as things stand now doctor circuit how easy would it be for that person to get tested

process_wavs/191.wav	the news media is constantly turning out updates and information

process_wavs/186.wav	San Francisco State University found that news about coronavirus discrimination increase by 50% across the country from February 9th through March 7th

process_wavs/58.wav	scientist in both China and the West have widely dismissed E-Series although that hasn't stopped them from spreading

process_wavs/148.wav	you started off by talking about the fact that you were hopeful about what you're now seeing in China

process_wavs/172.wav	and the entire ship was put in the quarantine

process_wavs/154.wav	really know the answer to that question

process_wavs/100.wav	what about over there how did businesses adapt to The New Normal

process_wavs/185.wav	but also in institutional policies like the Immigration Act of 1924

process_wavs/166.wav	John symptoms were not nearly as severe as clay Bentleys

process_wavs/65.wav	it becomes a little a little blurry there right it's not just about the economy in that situation

process_wavs/10.wav	which severely limited immigration from Asia and parts of Europe

process_wavs/104.wav	the best way to protect yourself is to practice good hygiene

process_wavs/288.wav	now some doctors are having to make those hard choices in real life

process_wavs/178.wav	make sure they could purchase groceries for them if they can't get out of the house

process_wavs/303.wav	finally if you have any questions please record them as a voice memo and email them to ask Sanjay at cnn.com

process_wavs/242.wav	these are myths and they really work

process_wavs/176.wav	maybe clear the novel coronavirus can infect anyone regardless of age with nicity

process_wavs/8.wav	the other drug name being floated around is an antiviral called run Desert View

process_wavs/174.wav	and there's also no way to know for sure what role heat or humidity have to play here

process_wavs/1.wav	CNN spoke to Arne Duncan the former education secretary under President Obama

process_wavs/84.wav	using the plasma of people who have recovered

process_wavs/69.wav	that's just one month

process_wavs/108.wav	and she's not alone

process_wavs/94.wav	it might even include them in the podcast

process_wavs/263.wav	that it's safe to go back to a more normal life where you can spend time with your kids again

process_wavs/142.wav	same three people overdosed on the drug after hearing it described as a possible treatment

process_wavs/11.wav	leaving aside International countries for a while would you recommend people not travel

process_wavs/220.wav	and maybe the right question is how should I act around my kids with regard to this in

process_wavs/270.wav	people who have underlying health conditions are those who are older do need to take extra precautions

process_wavs/250.wav	you know what strikes me Rachel that you all are being very diligent about this in in modeling right behavior and I hope people are listening

process_wavs/289.wav	it's not just individual attacks

process_wavs/17.wav	that the virus was man made in a lab

process_wavs/121.wav	we are seeing cases of the coronavirus currently spreading in hot countries

process_wavs/140.wav	I've heard this question a lot and there's some Merit to this concern

process_wavs/128.wav	then one day after 2 weeks he finally had a test come back negative

process_wavs/112.wav	what is the guidance the CDC is giving

process_wavs/25.wav	and there are multiple stages of those trials

process_wavs/88.wav	I'm in February roses business was down some 70 to 80%

process_wavs/133.wav	that's why in some states they are beginning to

process_wavs/269.wav	tip as much as you can

process_wavs/226.wav	my specialty is medicine not the economy

process_wavs/284.wav	the economy is also top of mine for New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo

process_wavs/66.wav	on February 6th one of the thousands of people who'd been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship with them tested positive for the virus

process_wavs/113.wav	we also don't know if it would cause problems during the pregnancy or affect the baby

process_wavs/68.wav	chloroquine is used to treat malaria and has been around for decades

process_wavs/271.wav	Gilead Sciences which manufactures RAM does severe is pulling back an emergency request for the drug due to overwhelming demand

process_wavs/193.wav	but if the narrative is look if you're young and healthy you'll be okay but the elderly people seventies and eighties in particular have a lot to worry about

process_wavs/247.wav	hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic commonly known as a z-pack could become game changers

process_wavs/158.wav	we're in this together so let's help each other out

process_wavs/188.wav	people who will inquire onto neighbor's well-being especially elderly in

process_wavs/207.wav	he narrowly escaped Wuhan just before the city was put in the lockdown on January 23rd

process_wavs/304.wav	the issue that I think a lot of people are starting to ask about is is this an either-or conversation is there either economic damage

process_wavs/153.wav	we've actually done a good job of staying in touch and it's been it's been really nice

process_wavs/201.wav	and this is what he said

process_wavs/3.wav	NBC News spoke to the wife who said they learned of the drugs connection to a coronavirus during a news conference on TV

process_wavs/81.wav	some point to the physics of the virus itself other point to the fact that kids major transmitters of the flu aren't in school anymore

process_wavs/92.wav	but we do know that pregnant women are more vulnerable to other respiratory illnesses like the flu

process_wavs/181.wav	I spoke to her in the hospital and asked if she was surprised it had now become the epicenter of New York State's coronavirus outbreak

process_wavs/208.wav	he says he's been seeing a lot of great leadership and creativity on the local and state level

process_wavs/59.wav	our team visited Nadia and her family at home last week to see how they've been doing

process_wavs/57.wav	your daily work changed I mean are you still seeing the same number

process_wavs/236.wav	of course everyone's situation is different

process_wavs/91.wav	there is currently no cure and while we're search is underway it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes available

process_wavs/111.wav	it's already been tested on adults diagnosed with a coronavirus in the United States and China

process_wavs/292.wav	director of the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention dr. Robert Redfield discuss friend as of year-end Congressional testimony earlier this month

process_wavs/219.wav	it was a recent small study of 9 women who were infected with the virus and none of their babies were affected by

process_wavs/290.wav	but now this is becoming a permanent home or at least temporary permanent home

process_wavs/152.wav	but I can reduce your ability to fight off an infection

process_wavs/135.wav	there are many home remedies doing the rounds drinking water or taking garlic or vitamin C

process_wavs/224.wav	but it really does strike me even when I've been at the hospital recently Justin that

process_wavs/49.wav	some of the rumors out there are ridiculous

process_wavs/6.wav	it seems Rachel sometimes the sentiment is I'm not taking it seriously

process_wavs/60.wav	or else damage

process_wavs/33.wav	I spoke with Rachel patzer director of the center of Health Services Research and Emory and her husband dr. Justin Schrager who's a physician in Emery's emergency department

process_wavs/28.wav	President Donald Trump is previously suggested that heat kills the virus and that it would be over by Spring

process_wavs/280.wav	from what we know so far about 80% of patients who get the novel coronavirus experience mild symptoms

process_wavs/82.wav	if you feel like you have symptoms of the coronavirus the best thing to do is to call your doctor

process_wavs/19.wav	but is there a concern though I mean not to paint a darker picture on this but there's a lot about this virus we still don't know

process_wavs/95.wav	before long john felt better

process_wavs/78.wav	comedy can't erase the hurt being felt by many in our country

process_wavs/134.wav	the president rebuking racism is a welcome development and the right thing to do

process_wavs/44.wav	hear Siemens medical analyst and infectious disease specialist dr. Celine gounder

process_wavs/4.wav	this is largely based on a small study in France that excluded some people who either left the hospital

process_wavs/138.wav	and some people the virus can stay in the body even after they're no longer showing symptoms

process_wavs/217.wav	she's in charge of the Medical Center's response to the growing pandemic

process_wavs/248.wav	how much do you think is is too much or how do you prefer to modulate how much information you're taking in

process_wavs/96.wav	that's my colleague kyung Law Senior National correspondent for CNN

process_wavs/143.wav	the best way to cheer yourself up is to cheer up someone else

process_wavs/38.wav	your approach in terms of how you convey knowledge and information whether it be an adult versus a child

process_wavs/257.wav	not everyone has been able to make it work like Nadia's family

process_wavs/64.wav	she herself was targeted

process_wavs/13.wav	meaning only the most serious cases would be reported and there were likely many more cases out there

process_wavs/183.wav	vaccine Trials take months or years in order to be proven safe and effective for humans

process_wavs/110.wav	this one is a case-by-case basis

process_wavs/79.wav	just last week Eugenie grey a blogger in New York was out walking her dog when a passerby kick the dog

process_wavs/169.wav	the Centers for Disease Control and prevention came out with a report last week that showed young adults between the ages of 20 and 44 were making up 20% of coronavirus hospitalization

process_wavs/2.wav	and then there's the prospect of a vaccine

process_wavs/24.wav	unfortunately the list goes on and on here's what President Trump had to say when a reporter asked him about

process_wavs/200.wav	I asked him how can you really put a value on human life

process_wavs/73.wav	after taking a form of chloroquine used to clean aquariums

process_wavs/293.wav	very hard to actually obviously do that in the hospital and I'm not talkin just in terms of care of patients I'm talking just

process_wavs/75.wav	but there are experts who believe it is actually much closer to 1%

process_wavs/231.wav	now these families at that are really suffering economically and they concerned that their quality of life is greatly diminished

process_wavs/103.wav	there was some early reports in Japan and China of people becoming re-infected

process_wavs/16.wav	and after touching it wash your own hands with soap and water

process_wavs/295.wav	people who get infected will typically get sick with a mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illness similar to a common cold

process_wavs/21.wav	so it's not clear if these young adults were more vulnerable to the infections than others

process_wavs/127.wav	were there any memorable moments that really stood out

process_wavs/34.wav	I believe him when he says that it's very unlikely that you'll get the virus again

process_wavs/62.wav	Banner Health a company that operates acute care hospitals released a statement on Monday confirming that a man in Arizona had died

process_wavs/30.wav	let me tell you what I know

process_wavs/235.wav	is there a concern that there could be a Resurgence of the infection

process_wavs/168.wav	and how for some people life is slowly beginning to get back to normal

process_wavs/155.wav	testing every individual given that you're not going to do anything different

process_wavs/76.wav	experts say one wouldn't be ready this year

process_wavs/206.wav	the risk of dying is still much higher in older people

process_wavs/223.wav	getting the results could take months and in the meantime

process_wavs/249.wav	they were worried because they've been told essentially stay home we can visit them

process_wavs/213.wav	I asked her if she knows anyone personally who is contracted the Coronavirus

process_wavs/195.wav	let's walk through some of the biggest myths and give you the facts

process_wavs/262.wav	and I'm just wondering

process_wavs/27.wav	experts are still trying to figure out the exact source of the virus but Research indicates that it likely originated in bats

process_wavs/296.wav	how should I talk to my kids about this

process_wavs/258.wav	this idea that is people start to come back together again

process_wavs/145.wav	anti-inflammatories can sometimes suppress your immune system

process_wavs/15.wav	check in on your neighbors

process_wavs/98.wav	local community sort of leading the way here in the United States and the federal government seeming to play a little catch

process_wavs/105.wav	stop taking the drug Duda side effects or gout worse including one person who died

process_wavs/46.wav	work on a study published last weekend that identified 69 existing drugs that could be tested against the Coronavirus

process_wavs/164.wav	sometimes you're slow down your breath and then the slowing down of thoughts follow

process_wavs/268.wav	and would begin trial starting Tuesday

process_wavs/276.wav	but if you have a weakened immune system or an underlying Condition it's better to take Tylenol

process_wavs/83.wav	umf worked on lots of pandemics and outbreaks in the past

process_wavs/254.wav	she's reporting on the coronavirus while also taking care of two young children at home

process_wavs/163.wav	after being asked what treatment he was getting you can hear him struggling to respond

process_wavs/287.wav	thankfully people have been calling out the racism they are witnessing

process_wavs/273.wav	but with an early diagnosis and the right treatment they too can recover

process_wavs/294.wav	the World Health Organization has said these methods are ineffective and shouldn't be used as I can actually irritate your skin or just burn you

process_wavs/129.wav	could what happened in China happen the United States and doesn't need to happen

process_wavs/72.wav	at this point it's not clear that pregnant women have a higher risk of getting sicker from the Coronavirus

process_wavs/278.wav	we all agreed that the even pull out one mask or one swab would be too much

process_wavs/117.wav	losing that sort of struck me was this this son, that I heard about

process_wavs/170.wav	it's hard to practice what you preach within your own job sometimes

process_wavs/146.wav	the state will also begin testing another experimental treatment

process_wavs/297.wav	his sentiments are being echoed by other celebrities and government officials

process_wavs/54.wav	but halfway through the coronavirus outbreak began

process_wavs/239.wav	Governor Cuomo's remarks got me thinking about medical ethics and some of the tricky hypotheticals we talked about in medical school

process_wavs/194.wav	you'll be happy to know the book I've been calling my parents more than ever you've met them and

process_wavs/279.wav	now if you've been in self-isolation at home you should consult your doctor before you make any decisions to come out of isolation and start interacting with anyone else

process_wavs/47.wav	and that there is maybe increasing suicide rates and things like that

process_wavs/275.wav	I spoke to him and asked what can we learn from China

process_wavs/285.wav	if you do think a service or packages contaminated simply use a disinfectant to clean it

process_wavs/272.wav	the disease can be fatal but those cases are rare

process_wavs/196.wav	bottom line is don't believe every piece of information you read on the internet

process_wavs/256.wav	and I'm sure you've all been hearing things from friends on social media and even on mainstream media

process_wavs/36.wav	but this new study is important because it shows that adults of all ages are at risk of getting really sick

process_wavs/261.wav	who studies inequality and activism at the Columbia University mailman School of Public Health

process_wavs/281.wav	I think it helped a lot of people

process_wavs/189.wav	he has subsequently reported from Beijing and Shanghai and how people adapted to the restrictions put in place

process_wavs/124.wav	it's possible that those people never fully clear the virus

process_wavs/14.wav	it's called convalescent serum

process_wavs/265.wav	they're probably wondering if they'll have a job tomorrow

process_wavs/90.wav	she's been with the CDC for over 30 years managing responses to H1 N1 SARS and Ebola

process_wavs/31.wav	Nevan Krogan a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of data science and biotechnology in San Francisco

process_wavs/246.wav	many people turn to especially during times of anxiety and uncertainty

process_wavs/42.wav	how did that strike you when you first heard these reports

process_wavs/50.wav	the researchers look into that and they think that wasn't actually what was happening

process_wavs/130.wav	like many parents out there last week CNN senior health producer Nadia kounang found out her children schools are closing

process_wavs/252.wav	sulfur part of this episode I want to hand things over to CNN's Chief business correspondent Christine Romans

process_wavs/234.wav	I think you're one of the few people who can really address this question

process_wavs/283.wav	for some Asian Americans like my colleague can law the damage has been done

process_wavs/301.wav	and almost half the patients were admitted to the ICU for adults under the age of 64

process_wavs/67.wav	he was tested every other day for the virus

process_wavs/264.wav	I spent a lot of time with her out in the field

process_wavs/199.wav	the company is instead focusing its efforts on giving out the drug in clinical trials

process_wavs/144.wav	remember Kate Winslet's character the virus Hunter

process_wavs/70.wav	alibris Archer on the project told the New York Times that this is only the tip of the iceberg

process_wavs/77.wav	I know that it can seem overwhelming

process_wavs/286.wav	there's this quote attributed to the writer Mark Twain
